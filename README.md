# Output explanation:
# 1. The program calculates the **average wait time** for each hospital by dividing the total wait time by the number of patients served.
# 2. It **ranks the hospitals** from least to most average wait time, making it easy to identify high-performing hospitals.
# 3. The program also displays the **number of patients** served by each hospital, which can help with resource allocation.

# Why this is useful:
# - **Improved Decision Making**: Helps hospital administrators make data-driven decisions about resource allocation, staffing, and operational improvements.
# - **Resource Allocation**: Identifying which hospitals have the highest patient load or longest wait times allows for better resource management.
# - **Operational Insights**: Helps benchmark hospitals against each other, leading to improved patient care and performance.
